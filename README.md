# quickdiff

## Prerequisite

If you are using Ubuntu, run `sudo apt install texlive perl latexdiff`

## Usage

Download the original and the revised source .zip files from Overleaf. Rename them to `origin.zip` and `revision.zip`.

Copy those .zip files into this quickdiff folder.

Run the scripts. HF!

`yijian.sh` is for generating the diff folder via two zip files (origin.zip, revision.zip).

`cleanup.sh` is to clean add generated files.
